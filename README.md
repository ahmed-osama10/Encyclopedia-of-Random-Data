# Encyclopedia-of-Random-Data
Create an encyclopedia of random data of 300 words ( either create it in a text file and import the data in the program later or create it in the program itself ) and then find out from these data the followings :
1- The number of letters in these 300 words (spaces included as well). <br>
2- The Repeated words in these 300 words. <br>
3- The longest word in these 300 words.<br>
4- The shortest word in these 300 words.<br>
5- The repetition number of each word in these 300 words.<br>

First write a non-threaded version and see how long it takes in time to Extract these data and then write it again but this time with a muilti-threaded version and calculate the speed up ( in milliseconds ) it took from the non-threaded one.<br>
Use the following functions with these exact names :<br>
1- Count : for the number of letters.<br>
2- repeatedwords : for the words repeated.<br>
3- longest: for the longest word.<br>
4- shortest: for the shortest word.<br>
5- Repeat: for the number of times each word appeared.<br>

These methods will be implemented using Rmi (Remote method invocation) but in the local machine.

include in the project a GUI ( Graphical user interface )
